# vanilla-schedule

üç¶ Why "vanilla"? Two reasons!

1. It's no frills! I'm just making something simple to keep track of when employees work.

2. No frameworks! It's üç¶JS!

Motivations -

1. Build something semi-complex w/o React.

2. Create a design system from scratch.

What I'm using here -

Front-end:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Webpack

Back-end:
- Node
- Express
- Mongo
