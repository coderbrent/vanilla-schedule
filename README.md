# vanilla-schedule üç¶

Why "vanilla schedule"? Two reasons!

1. It's written in vanilla JS! No React, no Angular, no Vue here!

2. It's no frills! I'm just making something simple to keep track of when employees work.

Motivating Factors -

1. To gain a better handle on DOM manipulation.

2. Create a design system and component library from scratch.

3. Build something useful that a small business can use.

What I'm using here -

#Front-end:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Webpack
- Babel

#Back-end:
- Node
- Express
- Mongo
