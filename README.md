# vanilla-schedule

üç¶ Why "vanilla"? Two reasons!

1. It's no frills! I'm just making something simple to keep track of when employees work.

2. No frameworks! It's üç¶JS!

Motivations -

1. Prove to myself I can build something complex w/o React.

2. OK I used Express to handle the endpoints, but honestly Express is such an awesome framework, I really don't feel like I'm cheating too much here!!

3. Make something actually USEFUL. I'm getting tired of building simple websites.
