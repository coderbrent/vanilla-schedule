# vanilla-schedule üç¶

Why "vanilla"? Two reasons!

1. It's no frills! I'm just making something simple to keep track of when employees work.

2. It's all in vanilla JS!

###Motivations -

1. To gain a better handle on DOM manipulation.

2. Create a design system and component library from scratch.

3. Build something useful.

What I'm using here -

###Front-end:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Webpack
- Babel

###Back-end:
- Node
- Express
- Mongo
